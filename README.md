To get the Coord run AHK then click 'Window Spy' use the Coord in 'Screen' under Mouse Position

All script have pause feature so use my mouse when I want to without click any hotkey



Enchant:

Under CONFIG change

Spin XY to the Green 'Spin!' button on the Enchanting window.

Fast XY is the Coord it will auto click at speed of 10ms in between the spin just for a little bit of efficiency, just put the Coord anywhere that doesn't interfere with anything I put top right near the red X bottun


I also include the code for Golden Enchant but no picture so feel free to put it yourself or even if you want other enchant Tinker Away!



Token:

Under CONFIG change

CollectXY, ClaimXY, ExitXY and FarmXY the same as Enchant change according to your Roblox whether its Fullscreen or Windowed and where you place it on your monitor IDK.

The 4H timer is in GMT+8 so it follows the time like 4PM -> 8PM -> 12AM, If you want it to be a normal Timer that start when you run the script then ask GPT to change it.



HatchClick:

Literally the same as using OPautoclicker or other software just added a feature where if the Roblox window is not focus or ALT + TAB the script will pause.
